# bootscreen3ds
Old School BIOS Generator for MenuHax Nintendo 3DS

THIS SHOULD NOT BE ADDED TO THE MAIN BRANCH OF BOOTSCREEN3DS, THIS MAKES SOME CHANGES THAT CHANGES THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE.

Now that's out of the way, this just fits the boot screen to fit on the bottom screen. :D

How do I use this?

1. Download this branch as zip

2. Run index.html

3. Select everything according to how you like it

4. Right click the image, select save as image.

5. Use a .png to .bin converter

6. LUMA3DS: Rename the file to splashbottom.bin, put in the the SD:\Luma folder

7. LUMA3DS: Launch the config menu and turn splash screen on
