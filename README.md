# bootscreen3ds
Old School BIOS Generator for MenuHax Nintendo 3DS

THIS SHOULD NOT BE ADDED TO THE MAIN BRANCH OF BOOTSCREEN3DS, THIS MAKES SOME CHANGES THAT CHANGES THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE.

Now that's out of the way, this just fits the boot screen to fit on the bottom screen. :D

How do I use this?

1. Launch the [site](Zmxhawrhbg.github.io/bootscreen3ds)

2. Select everything according to how you like it

3. Click download as bin

4. LUMA3DS: Rename the file to splashbottom.bin, put in the the SD:\Luma folder

5. LUMA3DS: Launch the config menu and turn splash screen on
